  The pthread_mutex_lock () function locks the mutex object specified by mutex. If the mutex has been locked, the thread calling this function is blocked until the mutex is available. The mutex object specified by the parameter mutex becomes the locked state when the function returns, and the calling thread of the function becomes the owner of the mutex object.

/*
We can release the mutex reference mutex object. The manner in which the mutex is released depends on the type attribute of the mutex. If more than one thread is blocked by the mutex object when pthread_mutex_unlock () is called, the dispatching strategy determines the thread that gets the mutex when the mutex becomes available. For a mutex of type PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE, the mutex becomes available when the count reaches zero and the calling thread no longer locks on the mutex.
